            <h3>ACCEPTABLE USE :</h3>
            <p style={{ color: "rgb(00,100,200)" }}>
              For purposes of this Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP"), a "Customer"
              is defined to include any organization, individual, company or
              other entity with which Angel Investment Network Ltd (AIN) has
              entered into any agreement or contract for the supply of services,
              including through the AIN website. A Customer shall also be
              responsible for the use of the AIN website by any subsidiaries,
              affiliates, partners, Authorized Staff, suppliers, clients, or any
              other person gaining access to the AIN website in any manner
              whatsoever, that directly or indirectly utilize the AIN website
              provided to the Customer. The Customer may only use the AIN
              website for lawful purposes. The use of the AIN website in
              violation of any local or international legislation or regulation
              is prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, transmission
              of proprietary or copyright material without the consent of the
              owner, material legally judged to be threatening, offensive, or
              obscene, and third party material protected by patent, trade
              secret or any other type of intellectual property right, whether
              or not the Customer was aware of the content of the material or of
              the relevant law. AIN will fully co-operate with investigations of
              suspected criminal violations and violations of systems or network
              security under the leadership of law enforcement authorities. Use
              of any information obtained via the AIN website is at Customers'
              own risk. AIN is not responsible for the accuracy, quality, or
              content of information obtained through NS Products. All AIN
              services are for end-user use only and may not be resold to
              third-parties without providing end-user information to AIN. The
              Customer will indemnify and hold AIN harmless from any claim
              brought by third parties alleging that use of the AIN website by
              the Customer has infringed any applicable local or international
              legislation or regulation. The Customer shall defend and pay all
              costs, damages, awards, fees (including reasonable legal fees) and
              final judgments awarded against AIN arising from such claims. The
              Customer shall immediately give AIN written notice of any claim
              the Customer is involved with or aware of. Should the Customer
              fail to do so, AIN may defend such claims at the Customer's sole
              cost. AIN will cooperate with any law enforcement authorities
              having jurisdiction to discourage and resist abuses of acceptable
              use policies. AIN reserves the right to take corrective action
              upon notification to AIN of unacceptable use by the Customer. AIN
              reserves the right, at its discretion and without notice, to
              remove any material or data and to block the use of the network
              for one or more users. The Customer may not circumvent user
              authentication or security of any host, network, or account
              (referred to as "cracking" or "hacking"), reverse engineer,
              decompile, deconstruct any programming, nor interfere with service
              to any user, host, or network (referred to as "denial of service
              attacks"). The Customer is forbidden to send e-mail to any person
              who does not wish to receive it. It is explicitly prohibited to
              send unsolicited bulk mail messages ("junk mail" or "spam") of any
              kind (commercial advertising, financial and investment promotions,
              political tracts, announcements, etc.) or to post the same or
              similar messages to large numbers of newsgroups (excessive
              cross-posting or multiple-posting, also known as "USENET spam"). A
              Customer caught spamming on the AIN, or who persist in the mass
              distribution of unsolicited e-mail messages, will be dealt with
              immediately in accordance with this AUP. The AIN website may be
              used by the Customer to link into other networks worldwide and the
              Customer agrees to conform to the acceptable use policies of these
              networks. The Customer agrees, through its own operations, not to
              cause disturbances, outages or other problems which may affect
              AIN's network or network based equipment, or which may adversely
              affect AIN's ability to provide services. AIN reserves the right
              to prohibit activities that violate this AUP or may damage its
              reputation. AIN will generally not monitor private electronic mail
              messages sent or received by its Customers but may conduct
              reasonable investigation of a Customer

              The Customer acknowledges that AIN is unable to exercise control
              over the content of information passing through its facilities or
              carried as a result of supplying the AIN website and is therefore
              not responsible for that content. AIN reserves the right, at its
              discretion and without notice, to automatically filter, disconnect
              and/or deny access to any Customer who violates this policy. This
              remedy shall also be applied when the Customer has engaged in any
              of the foregoing activities by using the service of another
              provider and, channelling such activities through a AIN account,
              re-mailer, or otherwise through the AIN website, or using a AIN
              account as a mail drop for responses or otherwise using the
              services of another provider for the purpose of facilitating the
              foregoing activities, if such use of another party's service could
              reasonably be expected to adversely affect the AIN website. AIN
              reserves the right, where feasible, to implement technical
              mechanisms which block multiple postings as described above before
              they are forwarded or otherwise sent to their intended recipients.
              Violation of this AUP (direct or indirect, including by a third
              party) entitles AIN to remove immediately the offending material,
              establish immediate or temporary filtering, deny access, suspend
              or terminate one or more subscriptions to the AIN website, or take
              any other appropriate action, as determined by AIN in its sole
              discretion, in addition to any remedies provided by any agreement
              to provide access to the AIN website. AIN may give notice of
              violations but AIN reserves the right to act without notice when
              necessary, as determined by AIN in its sole discretion. Nothing in
              this AUP is to be construed to limit AIN's actions or remedies in
              any way with respect to any of the foregoing activities, and AIN
              reserves the right to take any additional actions it may deem
              appropriate with respect to such activities, including without
              limitation, taking action to recover the cost of identifying
              offenders and terminating their access to the AIN website, and
              charging to cover AIN's costs in the event of such termination of
              access or like situation. AIN may co-operate with other service
              providers to discourage and resist abuses of acceptable use
              policies. AIN reserves the right to take corrective action upon
              notification to AIN of unacceptable use on other networks. The AIN
              website may be linked to other networks world-wide and the
              Customer agrees to conform to the acceptable use policies of these
              networks. The Customer agrees, through its operations, not to
              cause disturbances, outages or other problems which may affect
              AIN's or any other network or network based equipment, or which
              may adversely affect AIN's ability to provide access to the AIN
              website. Nothing contained in this AUP shall be construed to limit
              AIN's actions or remedies in any way with respect to any of the
              foregoing activities, and AIN reserves the right to take any and
              all additional actions it may deem appropriate with respect to
              such activities, including without limitation, taking action to
              recover the costs and expenses of identifying offenders and
              removing them from the AIN website, and levying cancellation
              charges to cover AIN's costs in the event of disconnection of
              dedicated access for the causes outlined above. In addition, AIN
              reserves at all times all rights and remedies available to it with
              respect to such activities at law or in equity. Customer will
              indemnify and hold AIN harmless from any claim brought by third
              parties relating to the Customer's use of the AIN website. The
              Customer must defend and pay all damages and costs (including
              legal fees) arising from such claims. The Customer must
              immediately notify AIN of any claim or potential claim, within the
              Customer's knowledge, involving the Customer related to the AIN
              website. Failure to do so gives AIN the right to defend such
              claims at Customer's sole cost and expense. AIN is committed to
              providing quality service to all of its Customers. While the AUP
              may appear harsh, AIN believes it is necessary to ensure that it
              is able to provide professional, efficient, stable service within
              an environment of security and trust which its Customers may
              require and come to expect from an organization such as AIN. This
              AUP is subject to change. Please contact us with any questions
              regarding the policy or to report a breach of AUP.
